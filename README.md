# VeryFiler
Small batch program that check supported by `FFmpeg` files

# Installation
For VeryFiler, you needed a [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). `ffmpeg.exe` must be placed with batch file in one directory. 

Or, if you have `FFmpeg` in PATH, you can skip that step. You can check it by calling `ffmpeg` in `cmd`, if no errors are apeared - all done!


All other steps program will do automatically after run (like creating input and output folders)

# About
